<h1>Geometry - Python Geometry Package</h1>
<p>Geometry is a python package for performing computational
geometry. Starting with the humble point, the package implements
increasingly higher dimensional objects: ellipses, circles, lines,
segments, rays, triangles, rectangles and rudimentary support for
working with graphs.</p>
<p>It's also a personal exercise in learning how to provide a high
quality python package:</p>
<ul>
<li>robust and complete operator implementation </li>
<li>rich setters and getters</li>
<li>appropriate use of exceptions and exception handling</li>
<li>designing useful base classes which are easy to subclass</li>
<li>high quality documentation</li>
<li>unit tests to confirm promised functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly though, it was super fun to write.</p>
